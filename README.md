# ProResD2
You will find below Codes and data used for the Prores project. To run the code and replay what is described in our deliverables, you will need to make reference to the adequate question within the different preped databases. Please check the detailed information on the answers code in D 6.2  to include the adequate data in your code. 
You might also need to change the files provided into .csv files. Please check the read options before running the codes to avoid errrors. 
It is also possible that some commands have evolved in the used codes due to python or conda updates. Please also check the syntaxes, and in case of deprecation, please correct the syntaxes or play the codes with the used environment versions.
